<!-- 
## How this project benefits the world

Running demos using Wine is a great way to find out what needs to be implmented or fixed in Wine and open-source GPU drivers.

<!-- 
## Why not just run demos directly or watch them on YouTube?
 - Many demoscenes were created decades ago and require outdated operating systems to run.
 - It's generally a very bad idea to execute binaries downloaded from the Internet.
 - Video recordings of demoscenes don't match quality of the original â€” low in resolution and frame rate, lossy audio codecs, fixed aspect ratio, etc; not to mention demoscenes weren't meant to be possible to pause or skip through.
